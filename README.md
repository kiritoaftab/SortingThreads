# SortingThreads
Design a java program to create three threads First thread implements quicksort, 
second thread implements merge-sort and third thread implements bubble sort,
all the three sorting techniques uses random( ) function to read random numbers and apply sorting techniques to sort the numbers..

This Java Program Produces a random integer of n numbers given by the user and applies the QuickSort, BubbleSort & MergeSort to them

It also shows the time Complexity of each of the sorting Algorithms
